# May-leetcoding-challenge
This is LeetCode's extension of their successful 30 Day LeetCode Challenge in the month of April'20 amidst the lockdown. 
This repo consists of my solutions to the problems I solved on each day. I coded them in Python3. All the problems can be found on LeetCode under the same name as that of my solution file. There is not code for taking user input in my solutions, since LeetCode handles that with it's test cases.
